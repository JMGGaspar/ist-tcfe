In this laboratory assignment, the main objectives were achieved: we were able to analyse the working principle of an band-pass filter, as well as understanding the various circuit architectures required to solve this problem. We were also able to work with circuits containing an Op-Amp, including this component for the first time in our work. 

The results from both sources, \textit{Octave} and \textit{Ngspice}, matched extremely closely, even though we used ideal models and some approximations, the results are quite close. This concludes that the both the theoretical analysis and simulation were well done.

The only problem of this laboratory was the low merit, derived from a big discrepancy on the central frequencies.
