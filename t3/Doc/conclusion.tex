In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analysing a circuit with a capacitor has been achieved. This circuit has been analysed using \textit{Operating point}, \textit{transient} and \textit{frequency} analysis. The \textit{Operating point} analysis was conducted like in the previous laboratory assignment, using node and mesh analysis. The \textit{transient} and \textit{frequency} analysis were based on phasors and on the nodal method using imaginary numbers.


The theoretical section has been solved using the {\em Octave} Maths tool to compute all the previous values. Those results were then confronted with the simulation results, which were obtained by using the {\em Ngspice} tool, resulting in an almost perfect match (with a level of precision of $10^{-5}$).
