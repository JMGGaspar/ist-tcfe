The objective of this laboratory assignment is to create a circuit that converts alternate current into direct current. This is achieved using an envelope detector and a voltage regulator, which consist, respectively, in a rectifier, a resistor and a capacitor, and in a resistor and a limiter. The rectifier used is a bridge rectifier as seen in Figure, and the limiter used is composed by group of diodes in series.
The stating schematic of the circuit is present of the following figure (Figure ~\ref{fig:schematic}):

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
