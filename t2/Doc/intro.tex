The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit supplied by two voltage sources and one current source. The two voltage sources (one dependent, $V_d$,  and one independent, $V_s$), and the current source ($I_b$), which is a dependent one, are connect to 7 different resistors ($R_{1-7}$) and to one capacitor ($C$). The voltage source ($V_s$) varies in time according to the equations \ref{eq:ut} and \ref{eq:vs}. The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:rc}.



In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
