\section{Results Analysis}

The simulation results match the predicted ones from the theoretical analysis with precision. This was expected due to the fact that this circuit only contains linear (dependent and independent) components.
Nevertheless, there are very small differences. This could probably originate from numerical approximation on either {\em Octave} or {\em Ngspice}.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\indent

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analysing a circuit with dependent and independent current and voltage sources has been achieved. This circuit has been analysed using the Mesh and the Node methods, which are based on Kirchhoff's Circuit Laws (KVL and KCL, respectively). 

The theoretical equations derived from applying the Mesh and Node methods have been computed and solved using the {\em Octave} Maths tool. These results have then been confronted with the simulation results, which were obtained by using the {\em Ngspice} tool, resulting in a match.
