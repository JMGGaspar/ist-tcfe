\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

This section discusses the circuit simulation, performed using {\it Ngspice}. 

This circuit was entered into the {\it Ngspice} simulation environment. This tool is used to simulate analog electronic circuits and predict circuit behaviour. 
This {\it Ngspice} simulation begins by defining the ground node, which is the node with potential 0 (by convention). In {\it Ngspice}, the ground node is represented by $V_0$. In our theoretical analysis, the ground node was defined to be node 4. However node 4 is still needed because we must introduce a voltage source with 0V potential, in order to measure the current Ic for the dependent voltage source, since {\it Ngspice} considers the voltage sources as Ammeters.
The new diagram, which represents more accurately what was introduced in {\it Ngspice}, is shown on Figure~\ref{fig:ngspiceCircuit}.

Table~\ref{tab:op} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
under analysis.
