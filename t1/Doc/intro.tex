The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing two voltage and current sources connected to various resistors. The two current sources (one dependent, $I_b$,  and one independent, $I_d$), and two voltage sources (one dependent, $V_c$,  and one independent, $V_a$) connect to 7 different resistors ($R_{1-7}$). The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:rc}.



In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
